# my_pomodorotimer
### Why another version of the pomodoro timer?
This is an easy to use version of the famous pomodoro timer. My aim is to write a C++ executable for myself, I don't like all the web versions and the community based versions. I need something that works offline and with the following functionalities:
- long and short breaks
- keeps track of the timers executed in the present day and if I switch off and on the laptop the counter for the day is NOT resetted
- i3 block integration (future idea)

Instead of looking around the internet for days I decided to write it on my own. 

### Usage
To see the help page just use:
```
./pomodoro.out -h'
```
